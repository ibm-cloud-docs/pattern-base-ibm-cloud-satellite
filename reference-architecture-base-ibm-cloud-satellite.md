# Base {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} 
{: #base-ibm-cloud-satellite}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-use-case="Managed cloud"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}

The Base {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} includes two common solution patterns:
- One or more {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} locations configured on-premises
- One {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is configured on-premises, and another {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is configured in the cloud

Due to privacy, regulatory, or compliance reasons, customers might not send or store data in the public cloud. In such scenarios, the best option is to create one or more {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations on-premises and hosts the data locally to satisfy the data residency requirement.

## Architecture diagrams
{: #architecture-diagram}

Figure 1 illustrates the {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} architecture where one or more {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations are deployed on-premises.

{{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} link connects on-premises {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. Customers might also choose to use Direct Link. Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation are two of the many other {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}}-enabled services in this image that are deployed in the {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location.

Figure 2 illustrates the hybrid {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} architecture where one or more {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} locations are deployed on-premises and the other {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is deployed in another cloud. The figure shows AWS as the hyperscaler.

A {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location can be created in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, AWS, Azure, or Google. In this example one location is shown on AWS, while the other {{site.data.keyword.satelliteshort}} location is on-premises.

## Design scope
{: #design-scope}

The base {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} solution covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- **Compute:** Bare Metal, Virtual Servers, Virtualization, Containers

- **Storage:** Primary Storage, Backup Storage

- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Network Segmentation

- **Data:** Data Storage (highlighting the Data Residency requirement)

- **Security:** Data Security, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint

- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, High Availability

- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Auditing/Tracking

The [Introduction to the architecture framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas to consider for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

In Figure 3, you can view the domains that are relevant in an {{site.data.keyword.satellitelong_notm}} solution.
