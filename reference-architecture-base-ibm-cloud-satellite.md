# Base IBM Cloud Satellite <!-- H1 -->
{: #base-ibm-cloud-satellite}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-use-case="Managed cloud"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}



Two common solution patterns are described here:
1.	One or more Satellite locations configured on-premises
2.	One Satellite location is configured on-premises, and another Satellite location is configured in the cloud


<!-- After the introduction, include a summary of the typical use case for the architecture. The use case might include the motivation for the architecture composition, business challenge, or target cloud environments.
-->

Due to privacy, regulatory or compliance reasons, customers may not have the option to send or store data in the public cloud. In such scenarios, the best option is to create one or more Satellite locations on-premises and host/store data "locally" to satisfy the data residency requirement.

## Architecture diagram <!-- this is an H2 -->
{: #architecture-diagram}



Figure 1 illustrates the IBM Cloud Satellite architecture where one or more Satellite locations are deployed on-premises.


![Satellite location on-premises architecture](/images/SatLoc-on-premises-architecture.svg){: caption="Figure 1. Base IBM Cloud Satellite Solution Architecture with Satellite location on-premises" caption-side="bottom"}



Satellite link connects on-premises Satellite locations to IBM Cloud. Customers may also choose to use Direct Link. Red Hat OpenShift and ODF are two of the many other Satellite-enabled services that are shown deployed in the Satellite location.



Figure 2 illustrates the hybrid IBM Cloud Satellite architecture where one or more Satellite locations are deployed on-premises and the other Satellite location is deployed in another cloud. The figure shows AWS as the hyperscaler.

A Satellite location can be created in IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure or Google. In this example one location is shown on AWS, While the other Satellite location is on-premises.

## Design scope <!-- H2 -->
{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs-draft/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), the base IBM Cloud Satellite solution covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

<!-- include all aspectsand domains relavant to the pattern below -->
- **Compute:** Bare Metal, Virtual Servers, Virtualization, Containers

- **Storage:** Primary Storage, Backup Storage

- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Network Segmentation

- **Data:** Data Storage (highlighting the Data Residency requirement)

- **Security:** Data Security, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint

- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, High Availability

- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Auditing/Tracking

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

The Figure 3 shows the domains that are relevant in an IBM Cloud Satellite solution.
